    "What makes a criminal? What if it was possible to assess future crime rates in the United States? What if it was possible to stop those future crime rates? According to many outlets, there are different social factors that play apart in the making of a criminal. Such as, living below the poverty level, not having a steady employment or income. My capstone project wants to analyze a child and the social factors that are placed upon them that could possibly contribute to them being lead the wrong way and how to stop this process. But also, this could possibly contribute to assess more funds for police departments due to a possible fluctuation in crime rates.\n",
